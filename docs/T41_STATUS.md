# T41 status

The T41 target is an in-progress port of the shared T4 OpenIMP implementation.
It is intentionally kept in the same encoder and FrameSource sources as T40;
platform branches represent measured public or kernel ABI differences.

## Verified on Wyze v4 / T41NQ

- `build-t41.sh` builds an OEM-independent `libimp.so` and resolves all 270
  IMP imports used by the target RVD and RAD binaries.
- The measured T41 public layouts are represented in the OpenIMP headers,
  including FrameSource, frame metadata, encoder channel, rate-control, and
  GOP structures.
- Both configured FrameSource channels enable against the stock T41 ISP. A
  real 1920x1080 NV12 frame reaches the shared encoder with valid physical and
  virtual addresses.
- T41 tuning uses request `0xc0105435` and the measured T41 control IDs.
- T41's rmem cache ioctl requires an OEM-sized minimum 1 MiB flush. Smaller
  `0x85c0`, `0x9000`, and `0x10000` probes faulted the caller; 1 MiB completed.
- The native AVPU register sequence is recovered from the stock T41 library
  and confirmed live: IRQ mask `0x5`, clock command `0x1`, 4 KiB command slots,
  status pointer at command `+0x5c0`, and a core-state transition from
  `0x80000000` to `0x80000003` after push. That transition is not treated as
  completion without an IRQ and valid status writeback.
- OEM `PrepareCommand` starts with a 4 KiB template and copies 17 non-empty
  command ranges through word 237 (`0x3b8` bytes), plus an optional 60-byte
  entropy block at `+0x800`. The recovered range table and bounds helpers live
  in `src/t40/t41_command_layout.c` and have a host regression test.
- `src/t40/t41_command_builder.c` now builds the complete observed command
  image without an OEM blob. Geometry, LCU history, source/reconstruction
  pitch, the `0x220` payload boundary, entropy words, and hardware-rate-control
  fields are derived from channel state. Physical buffer ownership and the two
  rotating per-picture offsets are explicit adapter inputs. Exact full-slot
  host oracles cover the captured 1920x1080 IDR and 640x360 first P picture;
  the builder also reproduces T41's padded FBC sizes (`0x214800/0x10a400` and
  `0x43800/0x21c00`) from geometry.

## Remaining correctness gate

The shared codec still populates only the T40 command fields at the start of
each T41 slot; the recovered T41 builder is not submitted yet. Its explicit
DMA inputs must first be connected to T41-owned FBC maps, EP1/EP2/EP3, motion
vector storage, and rotating picture offsets. Until that adapter is complete,
the core does not raise a completion IRQ and RVD does not publish a valid H.264
stream.

The next step is the T41 DMA-ownership adapter plus IDR submission, followed by
the first-P reference transition and decoder-clean stream gate. Performance
work and V4L2 support remain deferred until this stream is decoder-clean.
